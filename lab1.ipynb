    "### *Python type hinting\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good practice to use Python type hints when defining functions. Type hints are a way to specify the expected types of the function arguments and the return value. This can help you catch bugs early and make your code easier to understand. For example, the function `get_median` can be defined as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_median(numbers: list[float]) -> float:\n",
    "    # This function takes a list of floats as input and returns a float\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python ignores these type hints, so they do not affect the performance of your code. However, they are an elegant way to document your code and make it more readable. By just looking at the definition, you can quickly understand what the function does and what kind of arguments it expects, thus making it easier to include your functions in larger projects. You can read more about type hints in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)."
