    "In this lab, we will get familiar with the concept of a **perceptron**, implement it in `numpy` and fit it to some data with the use of **gradient descent algorithm**. On the basis of a perceptron, we will explore feed-forward neural networks and learn how to implement them easily using `torch`.

    "One of the fundamental algorithms used to train neural networks is the **gradient descent algorithm**. Before we dive into neural networks, let's first understand how gradient descent works.\n",

    "## Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The **gradient descent algorithm** is an optimization algorithm, which means it conducts a search for an argument $x$ of a function $f$ that minimizes $f(x)$. The function that we are trying to minimize in context of deep learning is called the **loss function** which measures how far the model's predictions are from the true values. The arguments of the loss function are the **model's parameters**, and thus the goal of training a neural network is to find the parameters that minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function.** Its components are the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each of its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent algorithm works by iteratively updating the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. The size of the update is determined by a hyperparameter called the **learning rate**. The learning rate controls how fast or slow we want to move towards the minimum of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The update rule for gradient descent is given by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\alpha \\cdot f'(x_n) $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $x_n$ is the current value of the parameter,\n",
    "* $x_{n+1}$ is the updated value of the parameter,\n",
    "* $\\alpha$ is the learning rate (a hyperparameter that you can tune).\n",

    "\n",
    "The simplest form of a neural network is a **perceptron**, which is a single node that takes an input vector $x$ and produces an output value $y$. The perceptron computes a **weighted sum of the inputs** and adds a **bias term**. The result is then passed through an **activation function**, which in our case will be the **sigmoid function**. Sigmoid function squashes the output of the perceptron to the range $[0, 1]$, which will correspond to the probability of the input belonging to the positive class.\n",

    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "For regression problems, the **mean squared error (MSE)** is a common loss function - you may remember it from linear regression we implemented earlier in numpy. The MSE is the average of the squared differences between the model's predictions and the true values. It is defined as:\n",

    "## Multi-layer perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "A **multi-layer perceptron** (MLP), also known as a **feed-forward neural network**, is a more complex model built by stacking multiple perceptrons together. This architecture allows the model to learn more complex patterns in the data, including those that are not linearly separable (like XOR).\n",
    "\n",
    "A feed-forward neural network is composed of perceptrons arranged in layers. **A layer is not a physical entity, but a mathematical operation that transforms some input data into some output data.** Each node in a layer is connected to every node in the next layer (thus we often call those network **fully-connected**). The connections between the nodes are represented by weights, which are learned during the training process. Each node calculates a **weighted sum of its inputs and adds a bias term**. The output is then passed through an activation function, which is what really makes a multi-layer perceptron different from simple linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical feed-forward neural network is composed of three types of layers: the **input layer**, the **hidden layers**, and the **output layer**. The input layer is the first layer of the network and just takes the data to be processed by the network. The hidden layers are there to transform the input data into a form that is more suitable for the output layer. They are called hidden because we usually do not observe their output directly - it is only presented as an input to the next layer of perceptrons. The output layer is the last layer and produces the final output of the network. The output layer usually has a different number of nodes than the hidden layers, depending on the problem we are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The activation function introduces non-linearity to the model**, and unlocks the ability of MLPs to potentially learn any complex pattern in data. For example, the aforementioned XOR problem can be solved by a network composed of two neurons in the hidden layer. The decision boundary of such a classifier would therefore be constr, which is enough to separate the classes of XOR data in its input space. MLPs are generally able to **approximate any function, given enough layers or neurons**, as described by the [universal approximation theorem.](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html)\n",

    "## PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a object-oriented library for deep learning, so in this chapter, we will work with classes and objects a lot. `nn.Module` is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. The neural network itself, the individual layers, the activation functions and the loss functions are subclasses of `nn.Module`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorch is built around the concept of **automatic differentiation**. This means that the library keeps track of all the operations that are performed on tensors, and can compute the gradients of any tensor with respect to any other tensor. In the previous exercise, we calculated the gradients of the loss function for a single perceptron manually. We really don't want to do this for a neural network with hundreds of neurons and layers. **PyTorch does this for us automatically, which is why it is so popular for deep learning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every instance of `nn.Module` should have a `forward` method. The `forward` method is the actual computation that is done in the network. When you call the network on a batch of inputs, the `forward` method is called with the input data as an argument. It is important to note that all the operations in the `forward` method should be differentiable - this is necessary for the backpropagation algorithm to work. In practice, this means that you should use the functions from the `torch` module to perform computations in the `forward` method. For a list of mathematical operations available in PyTorch, refer to the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#math-operations).\n",

    "## Data batches and stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\n",
    "\n",
    "When training neural networks using gradient descent algorithms, we do not usually fit the model to all the data at once. Instead, we tend to divide our training set into small chunks, called **batches**, and update model parameters after each batch. If the batches are drawn randomly from the dataset, the method is called **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**. This approach has proven to be very effective in practice, as it makes the calculations less expensive and the optimization process more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch library provides a class `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` which, given a dataset, generates the batches for us. The `DataLoader` class allows you to specify the batch size, shuffle the data, and use multiple workers to load the data in parallel to speed up the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual workflow of preparing the data for training a PyTorch neural network is as follows:\n",
    "* Load the data from a file or a database.\n",
    "* Convert the data to PyTorch tensors.\n",
    "* Create a `Dataset` object from the tensors.\n",
    "* Create a `DataLoader` object from the `Dataset` object.\n",

L2 regularization is implemented in PyTorch as the `weight_decay` parameter in the optimizer.

This encourages the weights to be small, which helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
